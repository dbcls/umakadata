        | This graph shows the relationships among some datasets in YummyData.
          If there is a triple whose subject and object belong to different datasets from each other,
          there is an edge connecting them.
          We manually chose a dataset each URI belongs to.
          As the fourth principle of Linked Data says, linking to another dataset is significant.
          We show this graph just for an experiment, and it is subject to change including removal in the future.
